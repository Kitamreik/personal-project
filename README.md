## Project Name & Pitch: Transformative Justice Practitioner Directory

#### Synopsis- as of January 9, 2023
* Name of Project:
    * Transformative Justice Practitioner Directory

* Explain Premise of Application:  
    * The premise of this application is to create a visual network of Practitioners across the United States showcased via a map interface and being able to click on the marker that the person has to find their information. In turn, this will allow the user to be able to reach out to a trained & mentored Practitioner for assistance in conflict resolution.

* Version 2 of the Application
    * The expanded version of this app has been deployed through Cyclic. The app has expanded to include a rotating class cycle application process, showcases of new students joining the cohort as well as students preparing for graduation via their curriculum projects. Futhermore, more context around mentorship, client relations and intake as well as detailing the class structure itself.

## Project Status - 2024-2025
* I am currently working on developing AI integration into my existing codebase.

* I have added new students to the website, having intermediate students deploy their projects and working on a booking platform attachment.

* I have implemented one round of class registration has been successful in line with the refinements of the website throughout the year.

## 2023 Insights and Goals
* Implementing the Google Maps API was relatively easier than anticipated
* Working on exploring Firebase/React Integration
* Creating more responsive design elements and modifying the site in that manner

## Project Status - 2023
* I have implemented more CRUD based interactions within the app.

* I have implemented a scroll button via Javascript to enhance the user experience, ease and access.

* I also used JS to alert a user when an item is about to be deleted and make an action to retain data when cancelled. Moreover, when there is a server error, there is an alert triggered as well.

* Future plans include: adding new students to the website, having intermediate students deploy their projects, as well as create an avenue for post-graduate connections and deployment.

## Project Status - 2022
* By May 20th, I project that the Back End will be flushed out to the best of my ability.

* I have made more modifications refining my Front End over the span of April 3rd - May 2nd. 

* By April 2nd, I project that the Front End will be flushed out to the best of my ability.

* As of March 23rd, I am working on coding the web pages as well as the Front End Development.

## 2022 Reflections
* Context: 
    * I am a Global Restorative and Transformative Justice Practitioner as well as an instructor in my daily work. The folks involved  are from a small cohort that I currently teach outside of class time for the past five years.

* Set out to build 
    * The website that I have designed has come together really well and my students and I will be contributing here indefinitely, connecting with folks as we traverse through the semester cycles.

* Project Challenges:
    * I think a challenge for me was the map component because it takes time to implement, however, the payoff and knowledge will be worth it!

<!-- * Unexpected Obstacles   -->

* Tools re: implementation  HTML, CSS, JS, APIs, Express, node.js, MongoDB
