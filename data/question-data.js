        question: "What does the groundwork and kind of cursory understanding of what these processes entail?",
        answer: "Usually myself, the apprentice, and/or a graduate that is taking the case on themselves or if said graduate is shadowing the instructor/apprentice on a case will have a variety of steps to follow when guiding clients from their initial point of contact with us, as students have been primed, trained and coached from start to finish to conduct these circles successfully. Clients will be connected with a Practitioner for an intake call that we suggest to have for about an hour, with the typical duration being around thirty to forty-five minutes. Clients do not need to know anything about restorative or transformative justice; all Practitioners that have graduated this program have committed their time, minds, hearts and hopes into an intensive, accelerated program, spanning two years and over one thousand hours of practice in the classroom and their communities throughout the pandemic.",

        question: "What are the time and general expectations to be had?",
        answer: "Generally, these processes take time and can really vary depending on the severity of the conflict, stabilizing and encouraging psychological first aid with those who were harmed, the pace of the participants (in line with what their needs are) and collective logistical scheduling and planning. Typically, from Kit’s experience, these processes can take around three weeks to eight months (or longer). Usually myself, the apprentice, and/or a graduate that is taking the case on themselves or if said graduate is shadowing the instructor/apprentice on a case will keep up communication throughout the process. When the process is in the termination stage, students have been trained in addition to the instructor actively implements the Community Follow and Follow Through stage within their own processes; this allows for any participant to check in with the Practitioner to share last sentiments, reflections, words of gratitude, and/or feedback regarding the facilitated process. This could be done through a retrospective, office hours that the Practitioner holds, etc. When most/all participants have expressed that they no longer need Follow Up/Through services, then the facilitation can gracefully close.",

        question: "How do I work when I take a case? How do students work in tandem with me when they receive a case?",
        answer: "You can read this link here: https://tj-practitioner-directory.onrender.com/client-relations to see how the general processes for this collective are conducted. If you’d like to know more about Kit or to learn where Kit’s mentorship background stems from, click here: https://tj-practitioner-directory.onrender.com/dev-updates. Most communication will be through email, although each Practitioner can use alternate modes of communication with the client and at their discretion.",

    {
        question: "What do student checkpoints and markers look like and how is progress measured throughout the program?",
        answer: "Students must have passed both the Fundamentals of Transformative Justice and Restorative Justice & Facilitation Theory via Research Integration with a 70% or better, via exams, independent projects and cumulative demonstration of class concepts before they are allowed to facilitate/shadow cases for their Capstone semester. These two classes allow the student to map out relationships from intakes, plan Circle processes, implement Crisis Response and Needs Assessment frameworks, as well as use Restorative Justice to look deeper between interpersonal relationships via consent training, bystander intervention training and conflict resolution modeling. Students must either pass a midterm or final if given for the class and/or complete their cumulative class projects outside of class time for revision, refactoring, in-class coaching and workshopping, Teacher’s Assistant office hours and final presentations at the end of the semester between their cohort mates for focused feedback and suggestions.",
