                    <li>"These two classes allow the student to map out relationships from intakes, plan Circle processes, implement Crisis Response and Needs Assessment frameworks, as well as use Restorative Justice to look deeper between interpersonal relationships via consent training, bystander intervention training and conflict resolution modeling."</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Students must either pass a midterm or final if given for each semester and/or complete their cumulative class projects outside of class time for revision, refactoring, in-class coaching and workshopping, and attending Teacherâ€™s Assistant office hours.

                    <br>
                    <li>Students then showcase their final presentations at the end of the semester between their cohort mates for focused feedback and suggestions.</li>
