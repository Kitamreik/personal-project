    <!-- Feature: breakdown and embed the booking form for initial interest  -->
    <!-- 1. Do: Review the entire website and understand the scope of the class.
    2. Fill out interview interest form by November 30th at 11:59pm EST. It will auto close December 1.
    3. Do: book calendly meeting by Dec 1 and meet by Dec 15. Interviews may be recorded for instructor/TA, mentor and/or current cohort review. If being recorded is an issue, please mention this to the instructor before the interview date 
    <a href = "mailto:kit.tjclasses@gmail.com?subject = ClassInterestQuestion&body = Message"> to the class email. </a> 
    
    -Prepare in the meantime: this class may be held in the afternoon/EST & morning/MT due to time zones. Class days are projected to be a single/combination of Thursday morning/afternoons, Saturday nights and/or Sunday mornings/evenings. Planning around 10 or less hours a week to the material tends to lead towards success. (This is an estimate of class time + homework/outside review + material review/re-watching recordings + potentially drop-in study groups/office hours)
    (give resources re: time management from syllabus)
    You do not need to know about TJ to take the course, it is designed and been improved upon for 3 years to allow for no/minimal/some basic understanding of TJ.
    -Prepare in the meantime: Do some preliminary research on transformative justice. What does it resonate for you? Why do you want to explore this? What will you envision for yourself on this journey? How can this curriculum help you as a person and your community? Note: some of these questions may come up in the interview process and will add weight if you prepare in advance.
    5. The instructor will review interviews from the 16th until the 26th and aims to have a turnaround time of Dec 27th. You will know if you have been accepted and/or waitlisted. If you are waitlisted, there will be another round of applications for June 2023. Since you have been waitlisted, you may be auto-approved to join then.
    6. Accepted students will receive a follow up survey to assess class times by Dec 30th. When that is done, students will be admitted to the Google Classroom platform, and the first class will be an orientation/ open Q&A with the instructor. The first class will happen by mid-January and repeat until June.
    Note: the cohort is projected to run until June 2023 or earlier, depending on cohort cohesion and pace of the class.
