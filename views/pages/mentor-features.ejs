                <p>Co-mentoring allows for dynamic, reciprocal and iterative relationships between the instructor, students and the mentor/guest speaker throughout the second and third semesters, which allow for more robust conversations and outlooks among students with topics that are outside of the curriculum. This also allows the student to reach out and build relationships with the co-mentors, on general advice and/or their term projects. These talks and/or their concepts are implemented for future cohorts.</p>
